# Example - Observer Design for Nonlinear System

This directory contains the example detailed in **Section 4.3 of Chapter 4**. It focuses on:

### ðŸ“Œ Case: Observer Design of a Nonlinear System Using an Hâˆž / LPV Control Approach, Through a Polytopic Formulation

#### ðŸ“‚ Main File
- **`Section43.m`**  
  *This script includes the modeling definition and observer design solution.*

#### ðŸ”§ Supporting Functions
- **`obs_LPV_pol_poleregion_hinf.m`**  
  *Function that computes an LPV polytopic observer with* $H_\infty$ *and pole placement constraints (defined as LMI region).*

- **`Simulations_section43.slx`**  
  *Simulink file that runs the simulation.*
