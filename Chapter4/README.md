# Quasi-LPV Models - Examples and Implementation  

This directory contains the code to study the examples of **Chapter 4:Control and observer design for nonlinear systems using quasi-LPV models: an illustration through examples**.  

- The directory **Section4.2** corresponds to the example in **Section 4.2:** $H_\infty$/LPV control of a nonlinear system.  
- The directory **Section4.3** corresponds to the example in **Section 4.3:** An $H_\infty$/LPV observer for a three-tank nonlinear system.
