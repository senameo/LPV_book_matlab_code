# Example 3.2 - LPV State Feedback Control with Fixed Performances

This directory contains **Example 3.2**, as detailed in **Section 3.2 of Chapter 3**. It focuses on:

### ðŸ“Œ Case 2: LPV State Feedback Control with Fixed Performances

#### ðŸ“‚ Main File
- **`Example3_2.m`**  
  *This script includes the modeling definition, control formulation, and control solution.*

#### ðŸ”§ Supporting Function
- **`LMI_ParameterDependentStability_grid.m`**  
  *Checks the parameter-dependent stability of an autonomous LPV system*  $\dot{x} = A(\rho)x$ *using a Parameter-Dependent Lyapunov Function.*
