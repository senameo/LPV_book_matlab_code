# Example - Flexible System Control with time-varying load

This directory contains Matlab and Simulink files to run the example provided in **Section 7.4 of Chapter 7**. The files to be considered are:

#### ðŸ“‚ Model File
- **`model_flexiblesystem.mat`**  
  *State-space models of the different flexible systems.*

### ðŸ“‚ Main File
- **`Section74.m`**  
  *Contains the whole program.*

#### ðŸ”§ Supporting Functions
- **`Yalmip/lmiHinfPolytope.m`**  
   *Yalmip/Matlab function that computes the LPV /* $H_\infty$ *controller by solving the LMI problem.*

- **`Simulations_section74.slx`**  
  *Simulink function that executes the simulation scenarios (the scenarios are chosen in the main file).*
