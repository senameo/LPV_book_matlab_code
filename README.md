## Overview of Provided Functions

A certain number of generic functions can be reused for stability analysis, observer design, and control design. Below is a list of some key functions:

### üîπ Stability Analysis

- **`LMI_ParameterDependentStability_grid.m`**  
  Checks the parameter-dependent stability of an autonomous LPV system given by:

$$\dot{x} = A(\rho)x$$

where:
- **x** is the state vector,
- **A(œÅ)** is the parameter-dependent system matrix,
- **œÅ** represents the varying parameters.

using a Parameter-Dependent Lyapunov Function.

### üîπ Control Design

- **`lmiHinfStateFeedbackRobust_expstab.m`**  
  Computes a robust state feedback controller for a polytopic system by solving an LMI problem.

- **`lmiHinfStateFeedbackPolytope.m`**  
  YALMIP/Matlab function that computes an **LPV / $H_\infty$** state feedback controller by solving an LMI problem.

- **`lmiHinfPolytope.m`**  
  YALMIP/Matlab function that computes an **LPV / $H_\infty$** controller by solving an LMI problem.  
  Developed by **Charles Poussot-Vassal** during his PhD studies at **Grenoble/GIPSA-lab**.

### üîπ Observer Design

- **`obs_LPV_pol_poleregion_hinf.m`**  
  Computes an **LPV polytopic observer** with **$H_\infty$** and **pole placement constraints** (defined as an LMI region).

## üìå Notes

- These functions are written in **[Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)** and rely on **[YALMIP](https://yalmip.github.io/)** for LMI writing. Solvers such as **[SeDuMi](https://sedumi.ie.lehigh.edu/)**, **[SDPT3](https://github.com/sqlp/sdpt3)**, and **[MOSEK](https://www.mosek.com/)** can be used for LMI solving.
- Note that Matlab and Simulink files are been written using the Version R2023a.
- The provided implementations can be used for research and educational purposes.
