 # About several LPV observers design methods for suspension systems 

This directory contains the code to study the examples of **Chapter 5: Observer design for semi-active suspension systems: qLPV approaches**.  

Three design methods of LPV observer are applied to the estimation of the damper force of a semi-active suspension systems.

- The directory **Method 1** corresponds to the approach detailed in **Section 5.5:** $H_\infty/gH_2$ LPV observer   
- The directory **Method 2** corresponds to the  approach detailed in **Section 5.6:**  $H_\infty$/LPV filter  
- The directory **Method 3** corresponds to the  approach detailed in **Section 5.7:**  a Nonlinear Parameter Varying $H_\infty$ observer  

The suspension system models corresponding to all approaches are detailed in **Section 5.4:** qLPV quarter car semi-active suspension models
